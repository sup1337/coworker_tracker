# coworker_tracker
This application is used to keep track about our employees' working periods.
Our application will use both a Wifi security system, and geolocation, to make sure that our dear employees are actually at the workplace when they try to start their schedule.
With the help of this application, the employer (aka me) will be able to see how many hours do our employees actually work, so we can calculate their payment correctly for overtimes and whatnot.
Also we can always see who are currently working, and who aren't.
We will hide a nice little game somewhere in the app for the employees to relax. The employer won't know about this. Shh!
